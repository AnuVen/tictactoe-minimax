# Tic Tac Toe AI 🎮🤖

A command-line Tic Tac Toe game written in Python, featuring a fully autonomous AI opponent using the minimax algorithm.
Made for an Artifical Intelligence class in university, I thought it would be worth uploading to my github.

## 🧠 Features

- Single Python file (no external libraries needed)
- Smart AI that blocks, wins, and plays optimally
- Input validation for smooth user experience

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
python tictactoe.py
```

# 🎮 Gameplay

Grid positions are labeled like this:

```
00 | 01 | 02
10 | 11 | 12
20 | 21 | 22
```
Enter moves as row + column (e.g., 1 1 for the center square).

📈 Future Upgrades:
- Add difficulty settings (e.g. random, smart, perfect)
- GUI mode
- Score tracking / leaderboard
